Vision Statement                               An Alma College education seeks to instill a love of learning and celebrate the joy of discovery. Each Alma student will experience a deeply interdisciplinary education that provides opportunity for self-reflection, hands-on learning, and personal and professional development. It will embrace the principle of local, national and global learning communities, build upon strong mentoring relationships, and integrate rapidly changing technology essential for current and future career paths.                               The Core Values                  Student-centered Education in a Residential Setting  \\u2014 All members of the community, faculty, staff and trustees, are committed to creating an institution of quality centered on the growth and development of each individual undergraduate student. The purpose of the residential college experience is to better prepare students to enter into lives in community, vocation, family, and faith.     Disciplinary Expertise within an Interdisciplinary Context of Learning  \\u2014 The Alma Experience allows students to apply intellectual rigor in exploring a range of disciplines, building a broad foundation in the sciences, humanities, fine and performing arts, and social sciences. This liberal arts education also prepares students to pursue advanced work, independent research, and creative performances with the depth of understanding to excel in one\\u2019s discipline and to perceive the connections among disciplines. The practical knowledge and skills of the liberal arts prepare students for lifelong learning and leadership within a wide array of vocations.     Engaged Learning  \\ufeff\\u2014\\u00a0Education takes place everywhere and all the time. Thus, Alma intentionally creates opportunities that extend learning into the community and wider world. Students actively participate in learning through research-based undergraduate scholarship and experiential, international, and service learning opportunities. This prepares graduates to practice engaged citizenship, service-driven leadership, and committed stewardship.     Ethical Integrity, Aesthetic Appreciation, Spiritual Sensitivity  \\u2014 With knowledge comes obligation. To live a complete life that withstands the scrutiny of self and others, individuals must exhibit personal integrity, respect for the value of all humanity, and sensitivity to the spiritual and material beauty of one\\u2019s existence. We expect these principles to be modeled in the educational programs, work, and daily interactions of all members of the college community and for graduates to practice them in their lives beyond Alma.

The university embraces diversity, encourages engagement and is committed to the discovery of knowledge, the education of undergraduate and graduate students, and improvement in the quality of life and standard of living of those we serve.   Kansas State University is a comprehensive, research, land-grant institution serving students and the people of Kansas, the nation, and the world. Since its founding in 1863, the university has evolved into a modern institution of higher education, committed to quality programs, and responsive to a rapidly changing world and the aspirations of an increasingly diverse society. Together with other major comprehensive universities, K-State shares responsibilities for developing human potential, expanding knowledge, enriching cultural expression, and extending its expertise to individuals, business, education, and government. These responsibilities are addressed through an array of undergraduate and graduate degree programs, research and creative activities, and outreach and public service programs. In addition, its land-grant mandate, based on federal and state legislation, establishes a focus to its instructional, research, and extension activities which is unique among the Regents' institutions.   Through quality teaching, the university is committed to provide all students with opportunities to develop the knowledge, understanding, and skills characteristic of an educated person. It is also pledged to prepare students for successful employment or advanced studies through a variety of disciplinary and professional degree programs. To meet these intentions, the institution dedicates itself to providing academic and extracurricular learning experiences which promote and value both excellence and cultural diversity. K-State prepares its students to be informed, productive, and responsible citizens who actively participate in advancing cultural, educational, economic, scientific, and socio-political undertakings.   Research and other creative endeavors comprise an essential component of K-State's mission. All faculty members contribute to the discovery and dissemination of new knowledge, applications and products. These efforts, supported by public and private resources, are conducted in an atmosphere of open inquiry and academic freedom. Basic to the pursuit of this mission is the university's commitment to broad-based programs in graduate education at both the master's and doctoral levels.   Faculty, staff, and administrators share their expertise through service to the university and disciplinary organizations via outreach, engagement and extension-related activities. Their work provides support to numerous projects related to the goals, missions or aspirations of the departments, colleges of the university, and to the members of the professional community. Through outreach and engagement initiatives, partnerships are established with various stakeholders to translate knowledge and basic research into applications that address public needs. These service activities are integrally related to the land-grant mission.

It takes its tone from the commitment of the  Sisters of Annunciation Monastery . These Sisters founded the university in 1959 and continue to sponsor it today. It is Christian, it is Catholic, and it is Benedictine.   The University of Mary Identity   Founded to prepare leaders in the service of Truth, the University of Mary is distinctive in our education and formation of servant leaders with moral courage, global understanding, and commitment to the common good. As America's Leadership University, we are deeply devoted to our mission.   We cherish our Christian, Catholic, Benedictine identity; we welcome and serve persons of all faiths.         We Are Faithfully Christian                 As a Christian university, we strive to accomplish our mission in faithfulness to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We regard each human person as created in the image and likeness of God, gifted with life and dignity. We seek to be agents of cultural renewal in our time and place \\u2013 courageous advocates for justice and peace.\\u00a0   Our Christian commitment is born from and sustained by the encounter of the Risen Lord, who came not to be served but to serve. As He humbly washed the feet of His disciples on the night before He died, so we seek to serve one another. We are faithfully Christian.   We Are Joyfully Catholic                 As a Catholic university, we joyfully draw our life from the heart of the Church, identifying with the ancient tradition which gave rise to the first universities in medieval Europe. This Catholic intellectual tradition proposes an integrated spiritual and philosophical approach to the most enduring questions of human life. Thus we seek to advance the vital dialogue between Faith and Reason, while acknowledging the proper autonomy of the arts, sciences, and professions.   A university is a place for the free exchange of ideas and so we warmly welcome students and faculty of many faiths and convictions. At the same time, our common discourse ever takes place in a spirit of authentic respect for Catholic teaching and practice. We acknowledge the Catholic faith as a path to moral integrity and personal holiness. We are joyfully Catholic.   We Are Gratefully Benedictine               As a Benedictine university, we remember with gratitude the Benedictine Sisters who came to Dakota Territory in 1878, bringing ministries of teaching and healing. This community of Sisters would become our founders and sponsors and, through them, we share in the 1500-year-old heritage of the Benedictines.   Inspired by lives of prayer, community, and service, Saint Benedict and his spiritual followers through the ages have been a stable source of tremendous good in the world: renewing the Church, preserving learning, cultivating wisdom, and modeling humane virtues of balance and generosity. The life of  our Sisters  shapes our life. We are gratefully Benedictine.   The University of Mary Statement of Mission and Identity was approved by the University\\u2019s Board of Trustees on Dec. 3, 2010.                 The University of Mary   Faithfully Christian.

The foundation for this is our mission. To probe deeply the mystery of existence by cultivating the ways of knowing and the arts of thinking.   Recognizing that the paths to knowledge are many, Saint Mary's College of California offers a diverse curriculum that includes the humanities, arts, sciences, social sciences, education, business administration and nursing, serving traditional students and adult learners in both undergraduate and graduate programs.   As an institution where the liberal arts inform and enrich all areas of learning, it places special importance on fostering the intellectual skills and habits of mind, which liberate persons to probe deeply the mystery of existence and live authentically in response to the truths they discover. This liberation is achieved as faculty and students, led by wonder about the nature of reality, look twice, ask why, seek not merely facts but fundamental principles, strive for an integration of all knowledge and express themselves precisely and eloquently.   To affirm and foster the Christian understanding of the human person which animates the educational mission of the Catholic Church.   Saint Mary's College holds that the mystery which inspires wonder about the nature of existence is revealed in the person of Jesus Christ giving a transcendent meaning to creation and human existence. Nourished by its Christian faith, the College understands the intellectual and spiritual journeys of the human person to be inextricably connected. It promotes the dialogue of faith and reason: it builds community among its members through the celebration of the church's sacramental life; it defends the goodness, dignity and freedom of each person, and fosters sensitivity to social and ethical concerns.   Recognizing that all those who sincerely quest for truth contribute to and enhance its stature as a Catholic institution of higher learning, Saint Mary's welcomes members from its own and other traditions, inviting them to collaborate in fulfilling the spiritual mission of the College.   To create a student-centered educational community whose members support one another with mutual understanding and respect.\\u00a0   As a Lasallian college, Saint Mary's holds that students are given to its care by God and that teachers grow spiritually and personally when their work is motivated by faith and zeal. The College seeks students, faculty, administrators and staff from different social, economic and cultural backgrounds who come together to grow in knowledge, wisdom and love.   A distinctive mark of a Lasallian school is its awareness of the consequences of economic and social injustice and its commitment to the poor. Its members learn to live \\\"their responsibility to share their goods and their service with those who are in need, a responsibility based on the union of all men and women in the world today and on a clear understanding of the meaning of Christianity.\\\" (From\\u00a0 The Brothers of the Christian Schools in the World Today: A Declaration) .

Vision Statement                               An Alma College education seeks to instill a love of learning and celebrate the joy of discovery. Each Alma student will experience a deeply interdisciplinary education that provides opportunity for self-reflection, hands-on learning, and personal and professional development. It will embrace the principle of local, national and global learning communities, build upon strong mentoring relationships, and integrate rapidly changing technology essential for current and future career paths.                               The Core Values                  Student-centered Education in a Residential Setting  \\u2014 All members of the community, faculty, staff and trustees, are committed to creating an institution of quality centered on the growth and development of each individual undergraduate student. The purpose of the residential college experience is to better prepare students to enter into lives in community, vocation, family, and faith.     Disciplinary Expertise within an Interdisciplinary Context of Learning  \\u2014 The Alma Experience allows students to apply intellectual rigor in exploring a range of disciplines, building a broad foundation in the sciences, humanities, fine and performing arts, and social sciences. This liberal arts education also prepares students to pursue advanced work, independent research, and creative performances with the depth of understanding to excel in one\\u2019s discipline and to perceive the connections among disciplines. The practical knowledge and skills of the liberal arts prepare students for lifelong learning and leadership within a wide array of vocations.     Engaged Learning  \\ufeff\\u2014\\u00a0Education takes place everywhere and all the time. Thus, Alma intentionally creates opportunities that extend learning into the community and wider world. Students actively participate in learning through research-based undergraduate scholarship and experiential, international, and service learning opportunities. This prepares graduates to practice engaged citizenship, service-driven leadership, and committed stewardship.     Ethical Integrity, Aesthetic Appreciation, Spiritual Sensitivity  \\u2014 With knowledge comes obligation. To live a complete life that withstands the scrutiny of self and others, individuals must exhibit personal integrity, respect for the value of all humanity, and sensitivity to the spiritual and material beauty of one\\u2019s existence. We expect these principles to be modeled in the educational programs, work, and daily interactions of all members of the college community and for graduates to practice them in their lives beyond Alma.

Since its founding in 1863, the university has evolved into a modern institution of higher education, committed to quality programs, and responsive to a rapidly changing world and the aspirations of an increasingly diverse society. Together with other major comprehensive universities, K-State shares responsibilities for developing human potential, expanding knowledge, enriching cultural expression, and extending its expertise to individuals, business, education, and government. These responsibilities are addressed through an array of undergraduate and graduate degree programs, research and creative activities, and outreach and public service programs.

To meet these intentions, the institution dedicates itself to providing academic and extracurricular learning experiences which promote and value both excellence and cultural diversity. K-State prepares its students to be informed, productive, and responsible citizens who actively participate in advancing cultural, educational, economic, scientific, and socio-political undertakings.   Research and other creative endeavors comprise an essential component of K-State's mission. All faculty members contribute to the discovery and dissemination of new knowledge, applications and products. These efforts, supported by public and private resources, are conducted in an atmosphere of open inquiry and academic freedom. Basic to the pursuit of this mission is the university's commitment to broad-based programs in graduate education at both the master's and doctoral levels.   Faculty, staff, and administrators share their expertise through service to the university and disciplinary organizations via outreach, engagement and extension-related activities. Their work provides support to numerous projects related to the goals, missions or aspirations of the departments, colleges of the university, and to the members of the professional community. Through outreach and engagement initiatives, partnerships are established with various stakeholders to translate knowledge and basic research into applications that address public needs. These service activities are integrally related to the land-grant mission.   Extension is governed by Kansas statutes that empower elected county councils and district governing boards with authority and responsibility to assess needs and conduct a local educational program in cooperation with Kansas State University and the United States Department of Agriculture. A network of local extension professionals and volunteers link Kansas State University faculty, the National Cooperative Extension System to the USDA, which produces high-quality educational programs.

It takes its tone from the commitment of the  Sisters of Annunciation Monastery . These Sisters founded the university in 1959 and continue to sponsor it today. It is Christian, it is Catholic, and it is Benedictine.   The University of Mary Identity   Founded to prepare leaders in the service of Truth, the University of Mary is distinctive in our education and formation of servant leaders with moral courage, global understanding, and commitment to the common good. As America's Leadership University, we are deeply devoted to our mission.   We cherish our Christian, Catholic, Benedictine identity; we welcome and serve persons of all faiths.         We Are Faithfully Christian                 As a Christian university, we strive to accomplish our mission in faithfulness to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We regard each human person as created in the image and likeness of God, gifted with life and dignity. We seek to be agents of cultural renewal in our time and place \\u2013 courageous advocates for justice and peace.\\u00a0   Our Christian commitment is born from and sustained by the encounter of the Risen Lord, who came not to be served but to serve. As He humbly washed the feet of His disciples on the night before He died, so we seek to serve one another. We are faithfully Christian.   We Are Joyfully Catholic                 As a Catholic university, we joyfully draw our life from the heart of the Church, identifying with the ancient tradition which gave rise to the first universities in medieval Europe. This Catholic intellectual tradition proposes an integrated spiritual and philosophical approach to the most enduring questions of human life. Thus we seek to advance the vital dialogue between Faith and Reason, while acknowledging the proper autonomy of the arts, sciences, and professions.   A university is a place for the free exchange of ideas and so we warmly welcome students and faculty of many faiths and convictions. At the same time, our common discourse ever takes place in a spirit of authentic respect for Catholic teaching and practice. We acknowledge the Catholic faith as a path to moral integrity and personal holiness. We are joyfully Catholic.   We Are Gratefully Benedictine               As a Benedictine university, we remember with gratitude the Benedictine Sisters who came to Dakota Territory in 1878, bringing ministries of teaching and healing. This community of Sisters would become our founders and sponsors and, through them, we share in the 1500-year-old heritage of the Benedictines.   Inspired by lives of prayer, community, and service, Saint Benedict and his spiritual followers through the ages have been a stable source of tremendous good in the world: renewing the Church, preserving learning, cultivating wisdom, and modeling humane virtues of balance and generosity. The life of  our Sisters  shapes our life. We are gratefully Benedictine.

The foundation for this is our mission. To probe deeply the mystery of existence by cultivating the ways of knowing and the arts of thinking.   Recognizing that the paths to knowledge are many, Saint Mary's College of California offers a diverse curriculum that includes the humanities, arts, sciences, social sciences, education, business administration and nursing, serving traditional students and adult learners in both undergraduate and graduate programs.   As an institution where the liberal arts inform and enrich all areas of learning, it places special importance on fostering the intellectual skills and habits of mind, which liberate persons to probe deeply the mystery of existence and live authentically in response to the truths they discover. This liberation is achieved as faculty and students, led by wonder about the nature of reality, look twice, ask why, seek not merely facts but fundamental principles, strive for an integration of all knowledge and express themselves precisely and eloquently.   To affirm and foster the Christian understanding of the human person which animates the educational mission of the Catholic Church.   Saint Mary's College holds that the mystery which inspires wonder about the nature of existence is revealed in the person of Jesus Christ giving a transcendent meaning to creation and human existence. Nourished by its Christian faith, the College understands the intellectual and spiritual journeys of the human person to be inextricably connected. It promotes the dialogue of faith and reason: it builds community among its members through the celebration of the church's sacramental life; it defends the goodness, dignity and freedom of each person, and fosters sensitivity to social and ethical concerns.   Recognizing that all those who sincerely quest for truth contribute to and enhance its stature as a Catholic institution of higher learning, Saint Mary's welcomes members from its own and other traditions, inviting them to collaborate in fulfilling the spiritual mission of the College.   To create a student-centered educational community whose members support one another with mutual understanding and respect.\\u00a0   As a Lasallian college, Saint Mary's holds that students are given to its care by God and that teachers grow spiritually and personally when their work is motivated by faith and zeal. The College seeks students, faculty, administrators and staff from different social, economic and cultural backgrounds who come together to grow in knowledge, wisdom and love.   A distinctive mark of a Lasallian school is its awareness of the consequences of economic and social injustice and its commitment to the poor. Its members learn to live \\\"their responsibility to share their goods and their service with those who are in need, a responsibility based on the union of all men and women in the world today and on a clear understanding of the meaning of Christianity.\\\" (From\\u00a0 The Brothers of the Christian Schools in the World Today: A Declaration) .
