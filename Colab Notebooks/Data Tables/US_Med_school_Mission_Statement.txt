State Medical School Mission Statement
CA University of California, Davis, School of Medicine To provide excellent learner-centered education to a diverse body of medical
students and graduate students; cultivating in them the passion to improve lives
and transform the health of the communities they will serve as physicians,
scientists and health care leaders.
Here our some ways we put our mission into ACTION:
Admissions Practices/Priorities-The Office of Admissions conducts holistic training
for all individuals involved in admissions, emphasizing their responsibilities, need
for confidentiality and other topics including implicit association (bias) and other
key factors influencing admissions decisions. All participants take a university
provided training related to diversity and inclusion, implicit bias, and anti-racism.
UC Davis utilizes a socio-economic disadvantaged score, based on AMCAS
information, to attach a numeric value to each applicant’s perseverance, grit, and
distance traveled, which becomes part of the holistic admission evaluation.
Beginning in 2009, UC Davis has implemented several successful strategies to
support enrollment of students from traditionally underrepresented in medicine
groups and those who plan to work in medically underserved areas. Students can
apply to enroll in: Accelerated Competency-based Education in Primary Care
(ACE-PC), a three-year M.D. program designed with Kaiser Permanente to bolster
the primary care workforce in California; TEACH-MS, Transforming Education and
Community Health for Medical Students, geared for students who want to work in
urban underserved areas; REACH, or Reimagining Education to Advance central
California Health, for students aspiring to work in the Central Valley; and the Rural
Program in Medical Education focusing on closing workforce shortages in rural
areas of northern California. COMPADRE or California Oregon Medical
Partnership to Address Disparities in Rural Education is a bold partnership to
address workforce shortages in Oregon and Northern California by connecting
students from underserved tribal, rural and urban communities to rewarding
medical school and residency experiences throughout the region. Finally, a new
CHS track is being developed for students committed to serving indigenous
communities.
Mission-focused Graduates-Over the past 10 years, over 75% of CHS graduates
have matched into primary care residencies. In 2021, US News and World Report
ranked UC Davis #4 in the U.S. for Diversity, #9 for Family Medicine and #11 for
Primary Care.
Student Life/Support Services-The Office of Student and Resident Diversity
supports all students with a focus on groups historically underrepresented in
medicine, working to cultivate a safe learning environment in which diversity can be
nurtured in an inclusive, accepting and productive manner. This unit is lead by our
newly appointed Associate Dean for Diverse and Inclusive Education and
Associate Dean for Diverse and Inclusive Learning Communities. The Office of
Student Learning and Educational Resources is a comprehensive academic
support unit providing assistance to students in developing learning strategies that
support their academic success and promote life-long learning. The Office of
Student Wellness develops and implements medical student wellness initiatives,
fostering collaborations that will lead to a culture of excellence and well-being. The
Academic Coaching Program utilizes clinical faculty to anchor and guide students
throughout their medical school journey. Coaches help students understand the
culture of medicine, their contribution to it, and how to identify and achieve their
goals.

State Medical School Mission Statement
FL University of Florida College of Medicine The College of Medicine strives to improve health care in Florida, our nation, and
the world through excellence and consistently superior leadership in education,
clinical care, discovery, and service.
We advance our mission through a curriculum and learning environment focused
on training our students above all to care deeply and well for their patients. Six
core competencies guide the training, assessment and feedback our students can
expect: medical knowledge, patient care, systems-based practice, professionalism,
communication and practice-based learning and improvement. Our curriculum
organizes the acquisition of medical knowledge and skills using a systems-based
approach, integrating basic sciences, clinical sciences, health systems & social
sciences, and wellbeing. We nurture a professional identity that strives equally for
excellence and kindness by providing structured encounters early and often with
standardized patients, placing small, diverse teams of students with dedicated
clinical faculty for long term mentoring, and immersing students in real world
scenarios where they collaborate with health and social services professionals,
faculty, trainees and of course patients to coordinate care, solve problems and
improve patient outcomes. Practice-based learning and improvement trains our
students to find and apply the evidence that leads to sound clinical decisionmaking. In addition, students have access to short and long term research
opportunities in nine scholarly tracks. We intend for all of our students to be strong,
culturally competent leaders in patient advocacy.
Service is embedded in training via the student-run Equal Access Clinic Network,
the Mobile Outreach Clinic, medical mission trips and other community
partnerships. UF Health’s wide service area promotes health systems-informed
practice and interdisciplinary, team-based training. In addition to the contiguous
Gainesville campus of six health professions colleges, six hospitals and nine
research centers/institutes, UF Health Jacksonville offers a downtown training
hospital, and multiple inpatient and outpatient practices serve patients throughout
North Florida and South Georgia. As such students have easy access to mentors
and teachers in over 100 primary care, advanced specialty and subspecialty
services.
A program based on care will not succeed without an environment that also cares
for students. Thus we provide robust student services including a full time
counselor, full time learning specialist, structured peer-to-peer mentoring program,
wellness curriculum and multiple mechanisms for students to contribute to ongoing
program improvement.
Our mission also informs a holistic admissions practice that seek those who are not
only medically informed, but exhibit throughout the application a genuine
humanistic drive, a desire to learn and work in teams for the benefit of a greater
good, and a willingness to be personally, academically and professionally
challenged. In evaluating the application and interview, we credit the endless ways
that individuals acquire and demonstrate the excellence, character, resilience and
skills that contribute to transforming good medical students into excellent doctors.
We evaluate the competencies we seek in part by asking applicants to reflect on
how their personal values intersect with medicine and to attempt to think like a
physician by responding to the narrative of a real patient encounter. As our
curriculum focuses on excellent patient care within a setting that prioritizes
community and student support, demonstrated kindness, caring and interpersonal
skills are key as we consider who will thrive in and enhance our community. This
manifests in the evaluation of essays, experiences and letters of recommendation
for interpersonal competencies, in one-on-one interviews, and in the incorporation
of our student and faculty community throughout our interview days to introduce
future students to our culture.

• helps you make powerful connections between the fundamentals of scientific
knowledge and the decision-making of patient care
• ensures that you have plenty of skills practice including patient interviewing,
clinical reasoning, forming differential diagnoses, and choosing among treatment
options
• teaches you the problem-solving skills and study skills that will prepare you for
standardized exams and that will support the life-long professional skill of medical
inquiry
• engages in a continuous dialog about developing your professional identity and
voice, gaining perspective on patients’ micro and macro barriers to receiving care,
and placing medical treatment in the context of health of individuals, families, and
communities
The College of Medicine recognizes that physicians in training must learn how to
be effective members of interdisciplinary clinical teams, how to search for up-todate, credible, professional sources of medical information, and how to navigate
the changing landscape of healthcare delivery.
The Illinois Medicine Curriculum is the product of our community’s collaborative
design process that includes students, faculty who teach medical sciences, faculty

State Medical School Mission Statement
MA Boston University School of Medicine Boston University School of Medicine is dedicated to the educational, intellectual,
professional, and personal development of a diverse group of exceptional
students, trainees, and faculty who are deeply committed to the study and to the
practice of medicine, to biomedical research, and to the health of the public. We,
as a community, place great value on excellence, integrity, service, social justice,
collegiality, equality of opportunity, and interdisciplinary collaboration.
BUSM is a social justice medical school. This emphasis on social justice is evident
in our curriculum and extra-curricular activities for students, in our faculty’s areas of
research and expertise, and in the patients we take care of.
Curriculum and Student Activities
Our curriculum was updated several years ago to emphasize patient context and
social determinants of health. In the classroom, our patients are never simply a
patient with a disease, they are a person with a family who lives in a specific place
and does a certain type of work…in the clinical setting, our students learn to
address each patient’s upstream health needs as well as their acute medical
needs; because we’ve learned that the best medical care in the world will fail to
make patients healthier if they still lack food, housing, etc. Outside the classroom,
our students’ most common activity is to participate in some of the 17 or so service
learning groups, which range from the “Outreach Van” street medicine initiative to
the “Teen and Tot” facilitated support group for young parents to the Socially
Responsible Surgery Club which allows students to visit surgical patients predischarge to ensure their understanding of their surgical problem and procedure
and plan for follow-up.
Faculty Research and Expertise
A unique feature of our social justice medical school is that we are in the context of
a Tier 1 research university. While our research enterprise is very broad, you see
the social justice mission thriving there as well. Examples include the Grayken
Center for Addiction, which supports research, education and treatment in addition
medicine, in the Health/Care Disparities Research Program within internal
medicine, and the Boston SOAR (Surgical Outcomes Analysis and Research)
which investigates inequalities in surgical care. 85% of our medical students
engage in Research during their time at BUSM.
Patient Population
BUSM’s primary teaching hospital is Boston Medical Center, which serves a
primarily underserved and extraordinarily diverse patient population. More than
half of our patients are from vulnerable populations who rely on Medicaid and/or
medicare for their health insurance; and 32% don’t speak English as their primary
language. Through our 12 affiliated neighborhood health centers, we reach deep
into the communities of Boston to find the patients that need us the most.

State Medical School Mission Statement
TX Texas A&M Health Science Center College of
Medicine
Our MISSION is to improve the health and well-being of the people of Texas
through excellence in education, research and health care delivery. Founded by
the Teague-Cranston Act, Texas A&M University College of Medicine was created
to serve the underserved populations of Texas with the core values of Texas A&M
University, namely Respect, Excellence, Leadership, Loyalty, Integrity and Selfless
Service. Today, we are leading the way for 21st century medicine through
research, clinical care, medical education, community impact, and innovation.
Our VISION is to develop the innovators and leaders in medicine and biomedical
research who will transform American medicine in the 21st century.
THREE DISTINCT PRIORITIES. Established in 1977 with a charter class of 32
students, the College of Medicine has evolved into a dynamic, student-centered
institution focused on the future of medicine and advancing three distinct priorities:
(1) Transformational Education for All Students: Bolstering each student’s
education by giving life-changing experiences and granting timely graduation with
low debt
(2) Discovery and Innovation for the World: Addressing the world’s most formidable
problems through collaborative research and entrepreneurial approaches
(3) Influence on the State, Nation and the World: Integrating Texas A&M’s landgrant origins with its top-tier research strengths to serve the state, nation and world
THREE AREAS OF EXCELLENCE distinguish the College of Medicine:
(1) Rural Population Health: The College of Medicine brings health care where it’s
needed most. Through our keen focus on rural populations and innovative care
delivery, the college eliminates health disparities throughout Texas.
(2) Military Medicine: The College of Medicine honors Texas A&M University’s rich
military legacy. Through our unique relationship with the TAMU Corps of Cadets,
military academies and veteran populations, the college improves the lives of
military members and their families.
(3) Innovation Through Engineering: The College of Medicine makes the
impossible, possible - by creating systems and technologies that address health
care’s greatest challenges and bringing together the brightest minds in health care
and engineering.
MEDICAL EDUCATION is the thread that creates a singular vision for future and
current students, researchers, alumni and practicing physicians. By impacting
education and training at all levels, the College of Medicine fosters achievement of
career goals and the transformation of health care for patient populations. Our
curriculum brings flexibility and individualization to the education process, to create
lifelong-learners and bring better health care to all. The College of Medicine
implements an updated and fully integrated curriculum providing students with a
pre-clerkship curriculum of 18 months. Students embark on their pre-clerkship
training at the Bryan-College Station campus for 18 months and then transition to
their campus designations for the remaining 2-1/2 years of training. Students have
several options for study across our campuses – each has a distinct environment
and offerings for education and lifestyle. The college provides clinical training
through affiliated medical facilities in Bryan-College Station, Corpus Christi, Dallas,
Fort Hood, Houston, San Antonio and Temple. The college is committed to
providing an environment that promotes the Aggie Core Values, inclusiveness and
compassion in its future physicians and scientists. Our emphasis on highly
integrated materials, organ systems-based instruction and institutionalized
programs for support between class years is proving to produce physicians with
the knowledge, expertise and vision to meet the challenges facing today's.
ACCREDITATION. In June 2020, the Texas A&M College of Medicine was
reaccredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) for eight
years, with the next site visit scheduled for the 2027–28 academic year.

goals to serve all WA communities, especially underserved and rural. Below are
some examples of how we enact our mission.
Admissions:
• Holistic Review: Our admissions process truly balances an applicant’s
experiences and attributes with their metrics in alignment with our mission. Once a
threshold combination of GPA and MCAT have been met for a secondary, we blind
these metrics – no one ever sees MCAT and GPAs! .
• Focus on WA: We consider only those who have ties to/residency in WA. We
ultimately hope our graduates will choose to practice in and care for WA
communities.
• Experiences with rural and/or underserved communities: one of the key
experiences we are looking for are those who come from or have experience with
these communities.
Student Affairs:
• Financial education: Over 50% of our student body comes from low
socioeconomically backgrounds. It is important that we have resources to support
them. On our Student Affairs team, we have a Director for Financial Education and
Scholarship Support who meets with students each year to build a plan for debt
management. This provides our students with the insights to select a career
specialty choice based on their passion rather than based on their debt.
• Our student interest groups include those focused on the broad diversity including
